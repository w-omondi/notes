1. Initialise a new repository.
2. Invite me to the new repository initialized.
3. Use the new repository to do all the interview workings.

- Implement two fragments pointed out in the Figma design.
- Make an API call on the product details page which is among the fragments designed.

	- Use that provided by the API to populate the page.
	- The endpoint of API you should be hitting: https://test.yellowdotenergy.com/getProducts
	- The API is a POST and the body looks like this.

                    {
                        _id: "63623c98d7c8dd6904cf7ef5",
                        fields: [
                            "_id", "name", "description", "price", "colors",
				            "keyDetails", 'sku', "keyFeatures", "image",
				            "otherImages", "shop", "weight", "dimension", "productDataSheet".
                        ]
                    }

     - You can also pass the fields you want back into the fields in the request body as shown above.

4. That's all, SUCCESS.
